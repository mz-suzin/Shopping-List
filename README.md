# Shopping-List
That very first and basic (right now not so basic) webpage with some DOM manipulations and stuff that seem complicated but are not.

V1 - add items to list using 'add' button or pressing the keyboard key 'enter'

V2 - toggle between bought and yet to buy items;
   - delete button added to delete unwanted items.
   - code is cleaner
